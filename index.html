      &emsp; There will be three species, and a two hour grace period. You may choose your own teams. Each player will have a set number of “lives” If you die, you lose a life. Killing someone grants you one life. You will be banned upon losing all lives. You may choose to donate one of your lives to someone and to revive people using a life. DM preY3RK#6871 on discord if you choose to do this.
